Task 1 : 
Aim : To get familiar with different network designs and hyperparameter search. Try methods to normalize the data.
Have a look at different architectures like VGGNet, AlexNet, ResNet etc.
- Try min 2 network definitions with min 5 hyperparameters each. Try to push the test accuracy above 80%. 
  Do this for both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.


Task 2:
Aim : To get familiar with performance of the network when variation in the dataset occurs. Try to reason about that using plots.
 - Train a network for the standar MNIST dataset. Test it on the test split.
 - Test the same network on the rotated MNIST dataset (w/o training on it) Report the performance. 
 - After this, report graph(s) that adds a certain percentage(0%,10%,20%..) of rotated dataset to the original dataset (X axis) and 
   report performance on a test split consisting of only rotated, normal and a mixure of both normal and rotated dataset(Y axis).


Deadline for both the tasks : 3 June 11:59 PM.
